# Curves_to_Parameters

Curves_to_Parameters is a library made in order to facilitate my research on a problem of prediction of material parameters from nanoindentation curves.
This library is composed of 3 modules :
                                          - Data
                                          - DeepL
                                          - Viz
                                          
                                          
Data is used to generate synthetic cuvres, process them into datasets etc.
DeepL is built on top of tensorflow2 and serves to train deep learning models on datasets generated by the Data module, it is also used to keep track of training results/trained models/
Viz is used for visualization, as you can see in the example notebook.
